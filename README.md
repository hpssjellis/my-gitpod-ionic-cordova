# my-gitpod-ionic-cordova


Learning more about Gitpod and Dockerfiles So far it seems that for gitpod use the Dockerfile only to install things using either apt-get or npm. The rest of the Gitpod workspace should be setup with the .gitpod.yml file that has much more power over the workspace.


I am still trying to figure out how wget fits into the whole plan. It does noot seem to work well in the Dockerfile however it should.
